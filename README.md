# DDPG_TORCS2
DDPG with Gaussian noise for autonomous driving in TORCS


Driving a Car in TORCS using Deep Reinforcement Learning

We need noise at test time too for this to work; the training factors in the exploration noise, so noise has to be included at test time too; without it the car fails to complete a lap at test time
